# To start the APP:

1. Start the backend server (https://github.com/TetianaHrunyk/chatgpt-faq-bot)
2. Make sure the REACT_APP_X_TOKEN in .env file is the same as APPLICATION_X_TOKEN in the backend .env file
3. install node modules:

   npm install

4. start frontend server

   npm start

### Notes:

- Normally I would not include the .env file in the repository, but since there are no real valuable information, I included it to simplify things
- I admit there is quite a bit of space for improvement in terms of UI/UX design)
